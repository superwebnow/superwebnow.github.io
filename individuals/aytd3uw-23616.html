She impressed the judges on America’s Got Talent, not only by mixing hip-hop, pop, and classical music on the violin, but by incorporating dancing with playing the violin, which she also does on her tours and official music videos. On a live-chat, Stirling explained, “It is very unnatural to dance while playing the violin. I had to practice so hard to learn how to do it, but now it is part of my expression and it comes naturally. I have to know a song perfectly before I can even begin to move. Once I know a song really well, I can then have fun dancing.” Not only in her performances, but also with her music, dancing made a huge impact: “I loved dance music so I started with that and wrote ‘Transcendence’, ‘Electric Daisy’, and ‘Spontaneous Me’.”</p><h2>Lindsey Stirling Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Lindsey Stirling is one of the <strong>richest Violinist</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Lindsey Stirling</b>'s net worth <strong>$12 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>At five years old, she discovered the violin and began training in classical music.&nbsp;She studied at Brigham Young University and worked in a youth center.

For live performances, she mostly uses Yamaha SV-250 Silent Violin Pro and Luis and Clark “Nero” carbon fiber acoustic violin. Stirling has been using the Yamaha Electric Violin since 2000, and the Luis and Clark violin was made famous after she used it in her cover version of “Radioactive” with Pentatonix in 2013. For studio recording, Stirling uses an early 1900s Ernst Heinrich Roth “Roth” acoustic violin most of the time and her Yamaha silent violin for an extremely clean sound. Before using the “Nero”, Stirling used her “Roth” during live performances. However, she stopped using the “Roth” live because she was sweating so much during the show. Stirling also owns three more violins which are a $40 eBay violin “Ingrid”, a purple Wood Viper Violin “Viper” and a Yamaha Silent Violin “Steampunk”. “Steampunk” is her first ever electric violin, and “Ingrid” is used for dangerous stunts in her music videos.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Violinist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Shortly after her performance on America’s Got Talent, cinematographer Devin Graham contacted her in hopes of collaborating on a YouTube video together. They agreed to shoot a music video for her song, “Spontaneous Me.” It was filmed the week of May 9, 2011. The video boosted Stirling’s popularity, and she began making music videos for her YouTube channel regularly. Stirling’s YouTube channel, Lindseystomp, which she created in 2007 and which is named after her first band Stomp on Melvin, is the main repository for her music videos. During 2011, the channel rapidly gained popularity and has over 2.4&nbsp;billion total views and over 11 million subscribers, as of November&nbsp;2018. Her music is featured on Pandora, Spotify, and Last.FM.

She later served as a missionary in New York City for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). A story she wrote about her mission was later published in the compilation Do Not Attempt in Heels: Mission Stories and Advice from Sisters Who’ve Been There. Stirling returned to Provo in 2009 to continue studying at BYU. She then moved back to Arizona, in December 2012, to be with her family. In August 2015, she graduated from the BYU Marriott School of Management with a Bachelor of Science degree in recreation management. She resides in Los Angeles.</p><p align=justify>Stirling’s performances were dubbed “electrifying” by the judges, and won the acclaim of the audience, but after she attempted to step up the dance level in her quarter-final performance, judge Piers Morgan told her: “You’re not untalented, but you’re not good enough, I don’t think, to get away with flying through the air and trying to play the violin at the same time.” Sharon Osbourne commented: “You need to be in a group. … What you’re doing is not enough to fill a theater in Vegas.” In her blog, Stirling confided: “I was devastated at the results … It was painful, and a bit humiliating; however, I had to relearn where it was that I drew my strength.” Stirling decided to continue to embrace her unique style of performance, promoting herself on the Internet. In a 2012 interview she remarked: “A lot of people have told me along the way that my style and the music I do … is unmarketable. But the only reason I’m successful is because I have stayed true to myself.”</p><h2>Who is Lindsey Stirling Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Lindsey Stirling</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
