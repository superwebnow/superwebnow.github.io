He was a businessman and philanthropist, who in 2003 was believed to have been the richest man in Russia, with a net worth $15 billion.&nbsp;His wealth was gained by controlling several Siberian oilfields under the name Yukos.</p><p>In 2003, he was arrested and charged under the President&nbsp;He was arrested in 2003 and charged with fraud under the regime of President <a href=#>Vladimir Putin</a>.

In 2003, Khodorkovsky was believed to be the wealthiest man in Russia, with a fortune estimated to be worth $15&nbsp;billion, and was ranked 16th on Forbes list of billionaires. He had worked his way up the Komsomol apparatus, during the Soviet years, and started several businesses during the period of glasnost and perestroika in the late 1980s. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in the mid-1990s, he accumulated considerable wealth by obtaining control of a number of Siberian oil fields unified under the name Yukos, one of the major companies to emerge from the privatization of state assets during the 1990s (a scheme known as “Loans for Shares”).</p><p>But instead of following this path, he exploited “quasi-official and often extra-legal business opportunities” and began to make a business career for himself. With partners from Komsomol, and technically operating under its authority, Khodorkovsky opened his first business in 1986, a private café. The enterprise was made possible by the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s programme of perestroika and glasnost.</p><p align=justify>Boris’ parents Marina and Marina were engineers.&nbsp;Inna was his wife. He got married in 1991.&nbsp;His daughter is Anastasia, and his sons are Pavel, Ilya, and Gleb.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mikhail Khodorkovsky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mikhail</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Khodorkovsky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Business Executive</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Moscow</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Russia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Inna Khodorkovskaya</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Anastasia Khodorkovskaya, Pavel Khodorkovsky, Ilya Khodorkovsky, Gleb Khodorkovsky</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mikhail Khodorkovsky ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In 1986, he met an 18-year-old, Inna, a student at the Mendeleev Institute who was a colleague of Khodorkovsky’s at the Komsomol organization. He courted her and slept in his car until she took him in. They had a daughter and twin sons.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Mikhail Khodorkovsky</b>'s net worth <strong>$100 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>In 1986, he earned a degree as chemical engineer from the D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology.</p><p align=justify>He relaunched his Open Russia Initiatives in 2014 to encourage reforms in Russian civil society.</p><p align=justify>Khodorkovsky’s parents, Boris and Marina Khodorkovsky, were engineers at a factory making measuring instruments in Moscow. Khodorkovsky’s father was Jewish, and his mother was Russian Orthodox Christian. They were both opponents of Communism, though they kept this from their son, who was born in 1963. Having experienced a rise in state anti-Semitism and the death of Stalin, the Khodorkovskys were part of a generation of well-educated Soviets who were silently supportive of dissidents.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$100 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Business Executive</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The young Khodorkovsky was ambitious and received excellent grades. He became deputy head of Komsomol (the Communist Youth League) at his university, the D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia, from which he graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1986. The Mendeleev Chemistry and Technology Institute was a popular choice for ambitious students ineligible for Moscow State University due to their Jewish heritage.</p><p>In 1987, Khodorkovsky and his partners opened a Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity of the Youth. In addition to importing and reselling computers, the “scientific” center was involved in trading a wide range of other products. The opening of the center eventually made possible the founding of Bank Menatep.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mikhail Khodorkovsky height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Mikhail <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After his graduation in 1986, Khodorkovsky began to work full-time for the Komsomol, which was a typical way of entering upon a Soviet political career. “After several years of working mostly to collect Komsomol dues from fellow students”, noted Gessen, “he could expect to be appointed to a junior position in city management someplace far from the capital.”</p><p align=justify>In the 1990s, noted Gessen, “Khodorkovsky made millions in currency trading. He also bought up privatization vouchers—documents distributed to every Russian citizen and entitling them to a share of the national wealth—which many Russians were happy to unload at a discount for ready cash. Khodorkovsky eventually acquired controlling stakes in some 30 companies. When Russia staged its greatest property giveaway ever, in 1995, Khodorkovsky was poised to take advantage of that too.” As Gessen explained, the Russian government, after the fall of Communism, “still nominally controlled Russia’s largest companies, though they had been variously re-structured, abandoned, or looted by their own executives.” A dozen men, the “new oligarchs”, including Khodorkovsky, hit upon the stratagem of lending the government money against collateral consisting of blocks of stock that amounted to controlling interests in those companies. The oligarchs and government both knew that the government would eventually default and that the firms would thus pass into the oligarchs’ hands. “By this maneuver”, wrote Gessen, “the Yeltsin administration privatized oil, gas, minerals, and other enterprises without parliamentary approval.” This was how Khodorkovsky came to own Yukos.</p><h2>Who is Mikhail Khodorkovsky Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mikhail Khodorkovsky</strong> married to <strong>Inna Khodorkovskaya </strong>.

As one of Russia’s first privately owned banks, Menatep expanded quickly, by using most of the deposits raised to finance Khodorkovsky’s import-export operations, which is a questionable practice in itself . Moreover, the government granted Bank Menatep the right to manage funds allocated for the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Khodorkovsky said:</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Mikhail Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Business Executive</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in Russia</strong>. Mikhail Khodorkovsky celebrates birthday on June 26 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Khodorkovsky also served as an economic adviser to the first government of Boris Yeltsin. “During the failed 1991 coup by Communist hard-liners”, Gessen wrote, “he was on the barricades in front of Moscow’s White House, helping to defend the government.” Shortly thereafter, having lost his faith in Communism, he and his business associate Leonid Nevzlin wrote a “capitalist manifesto” entitled The Man with the Ruble, which stated in part: “It is time to stop living according to Lenin! … Our guiding light is Profit, acquired in a strictly legal way. Our Lord is His Majesty, Money, for it is only He who can lead us to wealth as the norm in life.”</p><h3>Where is Mikhail Khodorkovsky today?</h3><p>Mikhail Borisovich Khodorkovsky (Russian: Михаил Борисович Ходорковский, IPA: [mʲɪxɐˈiɫ xədɐrˈkofskʲɪj]; born 26 June 1963) is an exiled Russian businessman, now residing in London.</p><h3>Who owned Yukos?</h3><p>Initially, Yukos, like most other Russian energy companies, was badly affected by the economic recession of the 1990s; subsequent to acquiring Yukos, accusations were made of other parties being squeezed out, and Yukos became formally owned by Rosprom, Menatep’s holding company.</p><h3>What do Russian oligarchs do?</h3><p>The main goal of the task force is to impose the sanctions set against these individuals to freeze and seize the assets that the US government claimed were proceeds of their illegal involvement with the Russian government and the invasion of Ukraine.</p><h3>How old is Putin?</h3><p>69 years (October 7, 1952)</p><h3>Is Sergei Pugachev still alive?</h3><p>He died in 2010.
