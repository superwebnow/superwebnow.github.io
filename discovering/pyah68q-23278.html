After inconsistent placings at numerous major events, the roster split up after a series of poor tournament placings, with Scump performing badly individually. They kicked FormaL and Karma and recruited players Sam ‘Octane’ Larew and Anthony ‘Methodz’ Zinni. But their problems weren’t solved, as they placed 5–6th at the CWL Anaheim open, 7–8th at stage two playoffs and 17–24th in the 2018 Call of Duty Championship. This was the first time since Modern Warfare 2 that OpTic Gaming failed to win a single championship throughout a season. OpTic Gaming later cut the two players that they had picked up the year before and picked up two prospects going into Black Ops 4: Thomas ‘TJHaly’ Haly and Brandon ‘Dashy’ Otell.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scump</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daniel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Friberg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Youtuber</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1995</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mechanicsburg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Seth Abner</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Shawn Abner, Kristen Abner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jordan Abner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Scump ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

However, after a 9th-place finish at the MLG Fall Championship and a 13th-place finish at UMG Philadelphia, Scump announced he would be leaving OpTic and joining Team EnVyUs alongside Merk, ProoFy, and Goonjar because of a rivalry with Nadeshot. Less than two-weeks after his departure from OpTic, Scump announced that he was leaving Envy and returning to Optic. He would rejoin the lineup of Nadeshot, MBoZe, and Clayster for the Call of Duty Championship 2014. The squad finished 3rd for the second year in a row. After that tournament, the team picked up ProoFy to replace MBoZe, who then became captain of OpTic Nation. The new team placed in the top eight at UGC Niagara, and was invited to attend the MLG X Games Invitational. Here, OpTic advanced all the way through their bracket to face Team Kaliber in the Grand Final. OpTic won, and Scump become one of the first gold medalists for Call of Duty. The next few events were inconsistent for OpTic, with 4th and 5th placings at Gfinity 3, UMG Dallas, UMG Nashville, and MLG CoD League Season 3 Playoffs.</p><p>Upon release of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, OpTic parted ways with Clayster and ProoFy and added Matt “Formal” Piper, Ian “Crimsix” Porter to the team. The team initially placed second to Crimsix’s longtime teammate Aches at the first event of the season, and afterwards placed first at UMG Orlando 2015, the MLG Pro League Season 1 Playoffs, and the Call of Duty Championship’s NA Regional event. At the 2015 Call of Duty World Championship, the team placed a disappointing 7th after they went into the event as the clear favorites. After the event, Scumps’s longtime teammate, Nadeshot, decided to leave competitive Call of Duty and was replaced by Damon “Karma” Barlow, with Scump becoming the team captain. As the new captain of OpTic Gaming, Seth led the team to 6 more championships and 2 more Pro League Regular Season wins to end the Advanced Warfare season. They won ESWC Zénith 2015 and Gfinity Spring Masters 1 with Enable in place of Karma, but as they returned to the United States they went to California to compete at UMG California 2015 with Karma. When they won UMG Cali it marked their 3rd straight event win in three consecutive weekends in three different countries. They then finished 1st in Season 2 of the MLG Pro League to qualify for MLG Pro League Season 2 Playoffs at the summer XGAMES in Austin, Texas, where he and OpTic defended their title and won his second gold medal. OpTic and Scump then finished 2nd to FaZe Clan at UMG Dallas 2015 and Gfinity Summer Championship. They bounced back as they won UMG Washington D.C. 2015 and MLG Pro League Season 3 Regular Season, where they went 11–0 in the season. Once again, they fell short and placed 2nd to Scump’s ex-teammate, Clayster’s FaZe team for the final time in AW. Scump then went on to win the final event of Advanced Warfare, MLG World Finals, with OpTic Gaming. He stated that the World Finals was the only event where he felt like he got carried, but it still marked Scump’s and OpTic’s most successful year by far. They won 9 championships, all 3 of the online Pro League Season, appeared in 10/11 Grand Finals, they won many online tournaments hosted by MLG and UMG, earned 1,651,320 pro points, and Seth had the most pro points out of any player with 447,975.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Scump height</b> Not available right now.
