Who is Tim Meadows dating now & how much money does Tim Meadows have?</p><h2>Tim Meadows Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Tim Meadows</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>TV Actor</strong> who was born on <strong>February 5, 1961</strong> in Highland Park, Michigan, <strong>United States</strong>. Actor, known as a cast member of Saturday Night Live and for portraying the character of Sam McPherson in the comedic mockumentary Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story.&nbsp;He’s also played television roles like the Principal Glascott as seen on ABC’s Schooled and Judd Tolbeck in CBS’s No Activity.</p><p>He was in the movie Mean Girls alongside&nbsp;He played a role in the film Mean Girls alongside <a href=#>Tina Fey</a>..</p><p>Meadows began performing improvisational comedy at the Soup Kitchen Saloon. Meadows’ start in show business was in Chicago as a member of The Second City comedy troupe alongside future star Chris Farley. In 1991, Meadows landed a spot on Saturday Night Live and would go on to become a longtime cast member, appearing on the program until 2000. (Meadows was on the show for ten seasons; this was the record for the longest tenure on the show until it was surpassed by Darrell Hammond in 2005, whose record was also surpassed by Kenan Thompson in 2017.) Meadows’ lengthy tenure on the show was used as a gag in three monologues when former cast members Phil Hartman and Mike Myers returned to the show to host, and when Alec Baldwin hosted for his twelfth time.</p><p>Meadows often spoofed famous personalities including Oprah Winfrey, Erykah Badu, Michael Jackson, and Tiger Woods, on SNL, and one time was a quick change artist to pull off an impersonation of both O.J. Simpson and Al Cowlings within the timespan of one SNL skit. Some skits had Meadows playing a fictionalized version of himself, such as being a fan of ice hockey on Weekend Update stating his dissatisfaction with the 1994 NHL lockout and remarking “What am I supposed to do about this; watch basketball?” Another sketch as himself was introducing the entire SNL cast as their most famous characters, such as Wayne and Garth, or Melanie Hutsell as Jan Brady in a sing-a-long denouncing the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which ends with Meadows remarking “This is personal to me…mainly because I don’t have an SNL character to play!” Eventually he did get an original character with Leon Phelps, “The Ladies’ Man”, a perpetually horny talk show host who falsely believed himself to be the living definition of what women search for in a man. The character was adapted into a 2000 film, The Ladies Man, which followed the character’s attempts to find love and a suitable outlet for his beloved radio program. In 2001, he co-starred in Three Days; in 2003 he appeared as Miles McDermott in The Even Stevens Movie.</p><p align=justify>The couple was married before to Michelle Taylor, and they have two children.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tim Meadows</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tim</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Meadows</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tv Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Highland Park</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michelle Taylor</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Isaiah Crosby Meadows, Julian Meadows</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tim Meadows ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
