With the erratic, fast-paced, and high-scoring Nuggets, he averaged 21 points through the final 24 games of the 1979–80 season, then proceeded with averages of 24, 25, 28, 26, 28, nearly 30 (in the 1985–86 season), 29, 25, 27, and 18 points per game during his decade-long scoring spree.

Denver won its division and secured the second seed in the Western Conference. In the 1985 playoffs, English averaged 30.2 points as the Nuggets defeated the San Antonio Spurs and Utah Jazz to meet the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, where they would fall to the eventual NBA-champion Lakers in five games. English suffered a right thumb injury in Game 4, which required surgery and rendered him unable to play for the rest of the series. With the Nuggets already dealing with injuries to other players, English’s injury was thought by some to have nearly ensured a Laker victory in the series. English later stated in a 2006 interview that “I think that if I had not broken my thumb […] we had a chance to beat the Lakers.”</p><h2>Who is Alex English Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Alex English</strong> married to <strong>Vanessa English</strong>.
