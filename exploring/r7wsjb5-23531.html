Pop singer who released the album Autobiography and was the star of her own MTV program, The Ashlee Simpson Show.</p><p>She first gained popularity with the help of her already famous sister, <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a>.</p><p>Following the commercial success of Jessica’s debut album Sweet Kisses (1999), Ashlee became one of her back-up dancers on tour. Hoping to pursue a career in acting, Simpson had a minor guest appearance on an episode of Malcolm in the Middle. The following year, Simpson had a small role as Monique in the Rob Schneider comedy film The Hot Chick (2002). She joined the seventh season of the family drama 7th Heaven as Cecilia Smith, a role which she continued to portray in the eighth season. Simpson appeared in a total of forty episodes as Cecilia. That same year, Ashlee recorded a song titled “Christmas Past, Present, and Future” for the holiday album School’s Out! Christmas; the song was later re-released on Radio Disney Jingle Jams following Simpson’s musical breakthrough. She later recorded the song “Just Let Me Cry” for the soundtrack to the film Freaky Friday (2003). Simpson later began writing and recording demos, in hopes of finding a record label. It was confirmed a month after the release of the Freaky Friday soundtrack that Simpson had signed with Geffen Records to release her debut studio album.</p><p>Ashlee was born Ashley Nicolle Simpson in Waco, Texas. Her parents are Tina Ann (née Drew) and Joseph Truett “Joe” Simpson, a former psychologist and Baptist youth minister. She has one older sister, Jessica Simpson. Both Ashlee and Jessica attended Prairie Creek Elementary and North Junior High, located in Richardson, Texas where the girls were raised. When Ashlee was three years old, she began studying classical ballet. She enrolled at the School of American Ballet in New York City when she was eleven, becoming the youngest person ever to be admitted into the school. Though the age requirement for the school was twelve, Simpson’s father admitted to lying about her age. During this time, Simpson suffered from an unnamed eating disorder for about six months, eventually receiving treatment from her parents. The Simpson family relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1999, as Jessica pursued a singing career. While Jessica launched her career, Ashlee began appearing in television commercials. Her father, Joe, served as her agent.</p><p align=justify>She married <a href=#>Peter Wentz</a> on May 17, 2008. They had a son named Bronx in November 2008, then divorced three years later.

She first performed the single “Pieces of Me”, and was set to perform the song “Autobiography” as the second song. As the second performance was set to begin, the vocals for “Pieces of Me” were heard again, revealing that Simpson had lip-synced her previous performance. Simpson began to do an impromptu jig as her band transitioned into playing “Pieces of Me” again. During the closing of the show, Simpson appeared with the guest host, Jude Law, and said, “I feel so bad! My band started playing the wrong song, and I didn’t know what to do, so I thought I’d do a hoedown.” The performance received significant media attention and was met with backlash. Days later, Simpson called music video series Total Request Live and explained that she was advised not to sing live due to acid reflux disease. Simpson said of the incident, “I made a complete fool of myself.”</p><h2>Ashlee Simpson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ashlee Simpson is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Ashlee Simpson</b>'s net worth <strong>$11 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She started studying ballet in New York when she was eleven.</p><p align=justify>She got caught lip syncing on Saturday Night Live in 2004.</p><p align=justify>Ashlee Nicolle Ross (née Simpson; born October 3, 1984) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. The younger sister of singer and actress Jessica Simpson, she began her career as a back-up dancer for her sister and appeared in television commercials at the age of 15. She later pursued a career as an actress and had a recurring role on the family drama 7th Heaven. Her breakout came following her appearance on the reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, broadcast on MTV between 2003 and 2005, which focused on Ashlee’s older sister Jessica and Jessica’s then-husband Nick Lachey. While working on her debut studio album, Simpson became the star of a spin-off reality series, The Ashlee Simpson Show, which was broadcast on MTV between 2004 and 2005. Like her sister before her, Simpson became the center of considerable media attention, much of which focused on her relationship with musician Ryan Cabrera.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$11 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Simpson wanted her debut album to consist of pop-rock music, as she did not listen to pop music. The project was produced by John Shanks, while Simpson co-wrote all of the songs on the album. She also worked with songwriter Kara DioGuardi on the album, with DioGuardi receiving credits on seven of the album’s tracks. The album’s lead single, “Pieces of Me”, became an instant hit in the United States. The song became a top-five hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and topped the Mainstream Top 40 chart based on pop radio airplay. “Pieces of Me” earned a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting 500,000 copies of the single being sold. Her debut album, Autobiography, was released on July 20, 2004, to a generally mixed critical reception. The album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States, selling an estimated 398,000 copies in its first week of release. It was the highest-selling debut album by a female artist that year, going on to sell over 2.5 million copies in the United States by January 2005. The success of the album and its lead single was attributed to the exposure from her reality television series. The album sold over five million copies worldwide.</p><p>It was announced that Jessica Simpson and then-husband Nick Lachey would star in their own MTV reality series, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. The series, which chronicled Jessica and Nick’s life as a married couple, became a pop culture phenomenon and helped draw attention to the Simpson sisters. Following the success of the series, it was confirmed that Ashlee would receive a spin-off series, The Ashlee Simpson Show. Hoping to end comparisons between her and her sister, Ashlee wanted the series to focus on the recording of her debut album. During this time, Simpson also dyed her naturally blonde hair brown, a decision that received media attention. While filming the show, Simpson appeared in the music video for musician Ryan Cabrera’s debut single “On the Way Down” (2004), portraying herself as Cabrera’s love interest. The couple later began a romantic relationship, with Cabrera inspiring multiple songs for Simpson’s album.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ashlee Simpson height</b> <strong>5 feet 7 inches</strong> Ashlee <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 7 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite the negative media attention surrounding the incident, Simpson released “Shadow” as the second single from Autobiography in the United States. The song did not receive a release in European territories. It failed to have the success of its predecessor, though it did reach the top twenty of the Mainstream Top 40 chart, becoming her second hit on the chart. The song lyrically spoke of her views towards her older sister’s success. The song received a positive critical reception, with some praising it as a highlight for the album. “La La” was released as the album’s third and final single in January 2005, and again failed to match the success of “Pieces of Me”. Despite a low peak on the Hot 100 chart, the song received a gold certification from the RIAA. The song served as only the second single in European territories. Simpson and Cabrera ended their relationship, though the two remained friends. At the Teen Choice Awards on August 8, 2004, Simpson received the “Song of the Summer” Teen Choice Award for “Pieces of Me”, as well as the “Fresh Face” Award. She also won the Billboard Award for New Female Artist of the Year in December, and in the same month, Entertainment Weekly named her one of its Breakout Stars of 2004.</p><p align=justify>Forbes listed Simpson as one of the “Richest Young Celebrities”, it is reported she earned $8.3 million in 2005.

The success of the single and her reality show helped propel her debut album, Autobiography, also released in 2004, to the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart. The project sold over five million copies worldwide, making it her most successful album to date. Simpson had a leading role in the film Undiscovered (2005), which became a critical and commercial flop. The failure of the film, along with multiple critically panned performances, led to much media scrutiny towards Simpson. Despite this, Simpson’s second studio album, I Am Me (2005), debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming her second album to do so. The album went on to receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Ashlee Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Pop Singer</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Ashlee Simpson celebrates birthday on October 3 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Simpson released her second studio album, I Am Me, in October 2005. The album featured similar pop-rock themes as found on her debut effort, though Simpson hoped to incorporate the feel of music from the 1980s into her sound. Much like her previous release, Simpson co-wrote all of the songs on the album. It became her second album to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 220,000 copies in the United States. The album failed to match the success of Autobiography, though it went on to sell over three million copies worldwide. The album’s lead single, “Boyfriend,” was written and composed about the rumors between Simpson and Valderama, and it became her second top-twenty hit in the United States. For the release of the album, Simpson went back to her blonde hair. The album’s second and final single, “L.O.V.E.,” entered the top forty in the United States. Simpson appeared for a second time as a musical performer on Saturday Night Live, performing the song “Catch Me When I Fall,” which was inspired by her previous appearance on the series, as well as “Boyfriend.” This time, both songs were performed without any adverse incident. In mid-December, Simpson collapsed after performing in Japan and was briefly hospitalized, consequently canceling an appearance at the Radio Music Awards. The collapse and her subsequent hospitalization were attributed to exhaustion as a result of her busy work schedule.</p><h3>Why did Ashlee Simpson stop singing?</h3><p>Days later, Simpson called music video series Total Request Live and explained that she was advised not to sing live due to <b>acid reflux disease</b>.</p><h3>What does Ashlee Simpson do now?</h3><p><b>She’s a mom to Bronx and Jagger, supports global charity work, and has even returned to the recording studio with husband Evan Ross</b>.
