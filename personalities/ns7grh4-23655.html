Recorded at Nigel Gray’s Surrey Sound Studio, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent’s “Don’t Care”, which peaked at No. 48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (“Can’t Stand Losing You”, issued in October 1978) as “Don’t Care” was released in early June 1978.</p><h2>Stuart Copeland Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Stuart Copeland is one of the <strong>richest Musician</strong> from Egypt. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Stuart Copeland</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was raised within Middle East. Middle East because of his archaeologist father.</p><p align=justify>He was ranked as the fifth most popular drummer of the past in Rolling Stone magazine’s reader poll in the year 2010.</p><p align=justify>Stewart Armstrong Copeland was born in Alexandria, Virginia on July 16, 1952, the youngest of four children of Alabama-born CIA officer Miles Copeland Jr. and Scottish archaeologist Lorraine Adie. The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. Later he moved to England and attended Millfield boarding school in Somerset from 1967 to 1969. Copeland went to college in California, attending United States International University and the University of California, Berkeley. Returning to England, he worked as road manager for the progressive rock band Curved Air’s 1974 reunion tour, and then as drummer for the band during 1975 and 1976.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Musician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>He is noted for his strong emphasis on the groove as a complement to the song, rather than as its core component. He once drove this point home at a drum clinic: Copeland announced that he would show the audience something “that very few modern drummers can do” and proceeded to play a simple rock beat for two minutes. Nonetheless, his playing often incorporates spectacular fills and subtle inflections which greatly augment the groove. Compared to most of his 1980s contemporaries, his snare sound was bright and cutting. He is also one of the few rock drummers to use traditional grip rather than matched grip. He is also noted for syncopation in his drumming.</p><p>Copeland grew up listening to a combination of Lebanese music, rock and roll, jazz, and reggae, but he selected from these styles what he needed rather than imitating them. In the 1980s, when many musicians were looking for bigger sound from bigger drums, he added Octobans. Invented by Tama Drums in 1978, Octobans consisted of eight six-inch drums in the shape of narrow tubes. He used another innovation, a splash cymbal based on a toy that he owned and that he helped Paiste design. He relied heavily on his 13″ hi-hats.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Stuart Copeland height</b> Not available right now.

The Police’s early track list (before their album debut) was largely Copeland compositions, including the band’s first single “Fall Out” (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B-side “Nothing Achieving”. Though Copeland’s songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all The Police’s songs together with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland’s most notable songs are “On Any Other Day” (where he also sang lead vocals), “Does Everyone Stare” (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out), “Contact”, “Bombs Away”, “Darkness” and “Miss Gradenko”. Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including “Peanuts”, “Landlord”, “It’s Alright for You” and “Re-Humanize Yourself”.</p><p align=justify>The Rhythmatist record of 1985 was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. He also starred in the film, which is “A musical odyssey through the heart of Africa in search of the roots of rock & roll.” (Copeland is seen playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.)</p><h2>Who is Stuart Copeland Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Stuart Copeland</strong> married to <strong>Fiona Copeland , Sonja Kristina </strong>.
