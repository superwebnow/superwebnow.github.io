Who is James Nesbitt dating now & how much money does James Nesbitt have?</p><h2>James Nesbitt Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>James Nesbitt</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>TV Actor</strong> who was born on <strong>January 15, 1965</strong> in Northern Ireland, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. Award-winning actor best known for his work in Cold Feet and for starring as the title character, Tommy Murphy, in Murphy’s Law.</p><p>He starred in the 2012 film The Hobbit alongside <a href=#>Martin Freeman</a>.</p><p>William James Nesbitt OBE (born 15 January 1965) is an actor and television presenter from Northern Ireland.</p><p>In an analysis of the film in the History & Memory journal, Aileen Blaney wrote that it is Nesbitt’s real-life household name status that made his portrayal of Cooper such a success. She reasoned that Nesbitt’s celebrity status mirrors that of Cooper’s in the 1970s: “A household name across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic [sic], Nesbitt’s widespread popular appeal is emphatically not contingent upon his Protestant Ulster identity, and consequently the double-voicing of the character he plays does not alienate viewers of an alternative, or no, sectarian persuasion.” Guardian journalist Susie Steiner suggested that his appearance in Bloody Sunday was an attempt to resolve the expression of his “Irishness” on screen: “Where he has taken part in a sectarian theme, his intelligence as an actor has often been masked by an excessive, cartoon-style comedy. Yet in his more successful, high-profile roles, (notably in Cold Feet, and as Pig Finn in the gently pastoral film Waking Ned), Nesbitt’s Irishness has been exploited for its romantic charm. It has been sugared and, in the process, de-politicised.” A critic identified Bloody Sunday as Nesbitt’s “coming of age” film, and Nesbitt called it a turning point in his career. He refers to his career since the film was released as “post-Bloody Sunday”.</p><p align=justify>He got married to Sonia Forbes-Adam in 1994. He has two daughters, actresses <a href=#>Mary</a> and <a href=#>Peggy Nesbitt</a>.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>James Nesbitt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>James</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nesbitt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Northern Ireland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sonia Forbes-Adam</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Peggy Nesbitt, Mary Nesbitt</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>James Nesbitt ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>When Nesbitt was 11 years old, the family moved to Coleraine, County Londonderry, where May worked for the Housing Executive. He completed his primary education at Blagh primary school, then moved on to Coleraine Academical Institution (CAI). In 1978, when he was 13, his parents took him to audition for the Riverside Theatre’s Christmas production of Oliver! Nesbitt sang “Bohemian Rhapsody” at the audition and won the part of the Artful Dodger in his acting debut. He continued to act and sing with Riverside until he was 16, and appeared at festivals and as an extra in Play For Today: The Cry (1984). He got his Equity card when the actor playing Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio broke his ankle two days before the performance, and Nesbitt stepped in to take his place. Acting had not initially appealed to him, but he “felt a light go on” after he saw the film The Winslow Boy (1948). When he was 15, he got his first paid job as a bingo caller at Barry’s Amusements in Portrush. He was paid £1 per hour for the summer job and would also, on occasions, work as the brake man on the big dipper attraction.</p><h2>James Nesbitt Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>James Nesbitt is one of the <strong>richest TV Actor</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>James Nesbitt</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He had hopes of becoming a Manchester United football player, or a teacher like his father.</p><p align=justify>He lived with Games of Throne actor <a href=#>Jerome Flynn</a> in the early 1990s.</p><p align=justify>William James Nesbitt was born in Ballymena, County Antrim on 15 January 1965. His father, James “Jim” Nesbitt, was the headmaster of the primary school in Lisnamurrican (near Broughshane), while his mother, May Nesbitt, was a civil servant. He has three older sisters named Margaret, Kathryn, and Andrea, all of whom eventually became teachers. The family lived in the house adjoining the one-room school where Nesbitt was one of 32 pupils taught by his father, while the other pupils were all farmers’ children. He grew up “completely” around women and spent a lot of time alone, “kicking a ball against a wall”. He had ambitions to play football for Manchester United or to become a teacher like his father. His parents were Protestants, and Lisnamurrican was in “Paisley country”. The family spent Sunday evenings singing hymns around the piano. Jim marched in the Ballymena Young Conquerors flute band and Nesbitt joined him playing the flute. After the Drumcree conflicts, they stopped marching with the band. The family’s residence in the countryside left them largely unaffected by the Troubles, although Nesbitt, his father, and one of his sisters narrowly escaped a car bomb explosion outside Ballymena County Hall in the early 1970s.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The day after leaving CSSD in 1987, Nesbitt got a bit part in Virtuoso, a BBC Two Screen Two television play about the life of John Ogdon. He worked for two days on the play, earning £250 per day. His first professional stage appearance came in the same year, when he played Keith in Up on the Roof. The musical ran at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, before transferring to the London West End. Nesbitt reprised the role when the production returned to Plymouth in early 1989. Roger Malone in The Stage and Television Today wrote that Nesbitt “steals the show with the best lines and best delivery as he laconically squares up to life with an easy contentment”. Nesbitt appeared in two other plays in 1989; in June, he played Dukes Frederick and Senior in Paul Jepson’s As You Like It at the Rose Theatre Club, and then appeared in Yuri Lyubimov’s version of Hamlet. Hamlet had been translated back to English from Boris Pasternak’s Russian translation. It ran at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester for a month before a transfer to the Old Vic and then a nine-month world tour. Nesbitt played Guildenstern, Barnardo and the second gravedigger. He recalled that the play received “shocking” reviews, but was exciting.</p><p>From 1987, Nesbitt spent seven years performing in plays that varied from the musical Up on the Roof (1987, 1989) to the political drama Paddywack (1994). He made his feature film debut playing talent agent Fintan O’Donnell in Hear My Song (1991). He got his breakthrough television role playing Adam Williams in the romantic comedy-drama series Cold Feet (1997–2003, 2016–present), which won him a British Comedy Award, a Television and Radio Industries Club Award, and a National Television Award.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>James Nesbitt height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> James <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Nesbitt had been approached at a British Academy Television Awards ceremony by director Paul Greengrass, who wanted him to star in a television drama he was making about the 1972 “Bloody Sunday” shootings in Derry. Nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause; he believed that there was “no smoke without fire” and that the Catholic marchers must have done something to provoke the British Army. He was filming Cold Feet in Manchester when he received the script. He read it and found that had “an extraordinary effect” on him. Nesbitt played Ivan Cooper in Bloody Sunday, the man who pressed for the march to go ahead. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day. He met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised Bloody Sunday Inquiry with them, and also read Don Mullan’s Eyewitness Bloody Sunday and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson’s Those Are Real Bullets, Aren’t They?. Greengrass compared Nesbitt’s preparation to an athlete preparing for a race, and told The Observer, “For an Irish actor, doing the Troubles is like doing Lear.” Nesbitt had questioned whether he was a good enough actor to effectively portray Cooper and was worried what Derry Catholics would think of a Protestant playing the lead, although Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant.</p><p align=justify>In the early 1990s, he lived with fellow actor Jerome Flynn and earned money by signing fan mail for the successful star of Soldier Soldier. In his debut feature film, Hear My Song (Peter Chelsom, 1991), Nesbitt played Fintan O’Donnell, a struggling theatrical agent and friend of Mickey O’Neill (Adrian Dunbar). A New York Times critic wrote, “the jaunty, bemused Mr. Nesbitt, manages to combine soulfulness with sly humor”. The praise he received made him self-assured and complacent; in 2001, he recalled, “When I did Hear My Song, I disappeared so far up my own arse afterwards. I thought, ‘Oh, that’s it, I’ve cracked it.’ And I’m glad that happened, because you then find out how expendable actors are.” His attitude left him out of work for six months after the film was released. Until 1994, he mixed his stage roles with supporting roles on television in episodes of Boon, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Covington Cross, Lovejoy, and Between the Lines. In 1993, he appeared in Love Lies Bleeding, an instalment of the BBC anthology series Screenplay and his first appearance in a production directed by Michael Winterbottom; he later appeared in Go Now (1995), Jude (1996) and Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). A Guardian journalist wrote that “he showed himself to be a generous supporting actor” in Jude and Sarajevo.</p><h2>Who is James Nesbitt Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>James Nesbitt</strong> married to <strong>Sonia Forbes-Adam </strong>.

Paddywack, in which Nesbitt’s character is suspected by others of being an IRA member, transferred to the United States for a run at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in October 1994. A Variety critic called Damien “the play’s only fully developed character” and commended Nesbitt for giving “the one strong, telling performance [of the cast]”.
