Who is Simon Hunt dating now & how much money does Simon Hunt have?</p><h2>Simon Hunt Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Simon Hunt</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Rugby Union Player</strong> who was born on <strong>July 22, 1981</strong> in Guildford, England, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. Simon Hunt (born 22 July 1981) is an English union footballer from the rugby union and director of rugby in the league of Old Bristolians having most recently played for the Dings Crusaders.&nbsp;Simon has played in club rugby throughout England, France and Wales and is a prolific scorer, who is also a point kicker.&nbsp;Simon has also international experience playing at a youth level in England and also having been centrally contracted with the England Sevens team during the period of 2011-2012 IRB Sevens World Series.&nbsp;Outside of rugby, Simon is ranked 87th in the world for an indoor row of 2000m (Ages 30 39).&nbsp;Simon is currently working as an PE teacher.</p><p>Simon returned back in England the following year and finished the rehabilitation process in the club of Sale Sharks before signing for Ebbw Vale playing in the Welsh Premier Division.&nbsp;In the 2004-05 season, Simon returned into England and played for Bristol Shoguns in National Division One scoring two tries on his debut in the game against Nottingham.&nbsp;Although he scored 3 tries over three appearances for Bristol however, he did not become a regular for Bristol and after a brief period at Pertemps Bees in the same division, he was signed by Ebbw Vale in 2005.&nbsp;A hat-trick by Vale in the match against Cardiff in September was a great display of his skill and ability and he would soon become a prolific points scorer for the club, scoring to both tries and points kicking in his second stint with the club.&nbsp;The form he showed with Ebbw Vale would lead to being called up by the Newport Gwent Dragons and he made his Celtic League debut against Edinburgh in the final game in the campaign.</p><p>The 2009-10 season was a tough one for Bees as they finished dead bottom of the league at the end of the regular season with just 1 draw from 22 games with Simon managing just 5 tries. However, due to the format of the Championship which split into three groups of four teams during the second part of the season, Birmingham & Solihull had a chance of redemption. They turned the form book on its head by winning 3 of their 6 games in the relegation group, sending Coventry down instead, and Simon finished as top try scorer for this stage of the season, ending with 11 overall. The Bees were less fortunate for the 2010-11 season as they finished bottom of the table for both stages of the season and were relegated despite Simon being the 3rd highest try scorer in the division with 17 tries overall. Following the relegation of Birmingham and Solihull, Simon chose to leave the club due to gaining a central contract with the England Sevens squad for the 2011-2012 season with a view to playing in the 2013 World Cup in Russia.</p><p>After a short spell with England Sevens in 2012 Simon returned to Birmingham & Solihull who were struggling in the 2011–12 National League 1 signing a two-year contract. He made 7 appearances for the club, scoring 4 tries but was unable to prevent them suffering a second successive relegation as the club dropped to National League 2 North. A player of Simon’s quality was meant to play at a higher level and he signed for nearby Moseley for the 2012-13 season. He stayed at Moseley for two seasons before moving to Bristol-based Dings Crusaders as a player coach, rejoining former team mate Mark Woodrow. Simon showed his try scoring quality at Dings with 14 tries but was unable to help the club stay up as they finished bottom of the 2014–15 National League 2 South and were relegated at the end of the season. Despite relegation, Dings did have some success by winning the 2015 Bristol Combination Cup with Simon scoring in the final against Cleve. After leaving Ding’s Simon joined Old Bristolians (playing in Tribute Western Counties North) as Director of Rugby for the 2015-16 season.</p><p align=justify>At the end of summer 2002 Simon was released from London Irish and relocated to France where he joined the Top 16 club, Narbonne in his 2002-03 campaign.&nbsp;Near the end of the season, he was moving to sign for another French club which was the awe-inspiring Perpignan.&nbsp;The club made it to the semi-finals of the Heineken Cup that year, losing to Toulouse at Lansdowne Road (a match Simon did not take part in personally).&nbsp;The following season, Hunt suffered a severe multiple-ligament injuries to his right leg.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Simon Hunt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Simon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hunt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rugby Union Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guildford</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Simon Hunt ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
