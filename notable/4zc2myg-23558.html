Electronic composer who gained fame for being the second half of house duo that sold platinum Daft Punk and as a part of Stardust.</p><p>He composed the score for the short film from 2012 First Point, featuring&nbsp;He provided the score to the 2012 short film First Point, featuring <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a>..</p><p>Thomas Bangalter (French pronunciation:&nbsp;​[tɔma bɑ̃ɡaltɛʁ] ; born 3 January 1975) is a French musician. He is best known as one half of the French house music duo Daft Punk, alongside Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. He has recorded and released music as a member of the trio Stardust, the duo Together, and as a solo artist including compositions for films such as Irréversible. Bangalter’s work has influenced a wide range of artists, many of whom are involved in different genres.</p><p>Bangalter met Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo while attending the Lycée Carnot school in 1987. They discovered their mutual fascination with films and music of the 1960s and 1970s, “very basic cult teenager things, from Easy Rider to the Velvet Underground.” They and Laurent Brancowitz eventually joined to form an indie rock trio called Darlin’, in which Bangalter performed bass guitar. Bangalter felt that “It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It’s like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band.” A negative review from Melody Maker magazine referred to their music as “a daft punky thrash”, which inspired Bangalter and de Homem-Christo’s new band name.</p><p align=justify>He had two sons: Tara-Jay and Roxan along with French model&nbsp;He fathered two sons, Tara-Jay and Roxan, with French actress <a href=#>Elodie Bouchez</a>..</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Thomas Bangalter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Thomas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bangalter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dj</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paris</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Île-de-France</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>France</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Élodie Bouchez</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tara-Jay Bangalter, Roxan Bangalter</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Thomas Bangalter ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He began playing the piano at the age of six. He has stated that his parents were strict in keeping up his practice, for which he later thanked them. His father, Daniel Vangarde, was a songwriter and producer for performers such as the Gibson Brothers, Ottawan, and Sheila B. Devotion. As expressed by Bangalter, “I never had any intention to do what my father was doing.” Bangalter’s father is Jewish, but the family did not consider themselves religious.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$70 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>DJ</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Vangarde was thanked for his efforts in the liner notes of Homework. The title of the album is partially attributed to the fact that Homework was recorded in Bangalter’s bedroom. As he remarked, “I had to move the bed into another room to make space for the gear.” In the years following the 1997 release, Bangalter focused on his own record label, Roulé (“rolled” in French). The label released singles by Romanthony, Roy Davis Jr., and Bangalter’s own solo material among others. Bangalter’s solo works were released on two vinyl-only EPs titled Trax on da Rocks in 1995 and 1998 respectively. The songs “Outrun”, “Extra Dry” and “Turbo” from the EPs later appeared in the video game Midnight Club II. The track “On da Rocks” was featured in a “Da Funk” behind-the-scenes video included with D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes. Bangalter collaborated with Alan Braxe and Benjamin Diamond and in 1998 released the club hit “Music Sounds Better with You” under the name Stardust. Just as for Homework, the single was recorded in Bangalter’s home studio.</p><p>During 1998, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo collaborated with Romanthony in what would become the first of the Discovery sessions. One of tracks produced, “One More Time” became Daft Punk’s most successful single in 2000. Bangalter also performed on a Yamaha Cs-60 synthesizer on the track “Embuscade” in Phoenix’s debut album United, which was released the same year. He also teamed up with DJ Falcon under the name Together to release their eponymous 2000 single.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Thomas Bangalter height</b> <strong>6 ft 2 in</strong> Thomas <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 2 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Shortly before reaching the age of 18, Daft Punk grew interested in electronic music, which led Brancowitz to leave the group in pursuit of efforts with fellow Parisian band Phoenix. In 1993 Bangalter presented a demo of Daft Punk material to Stuart Macmillan of Slam that led to their first single “The New Wave”. Daniel Vangarde provided valuable advice for the duo. “He helped us by presenting to us what the situation was with the record industry and how it worked. Knowing that, we made certain choices in order to achieve what we wanted.”</p><p align=justify>Bangalter is married to French actress Élodie Bouchez, with whom he has two sons named Tara-Jay (born 2002) and Roxan (born 2008).
