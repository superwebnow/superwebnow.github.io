Who is Aakash Chopra dating now & how much money does Aakash Chopra have?</p><h2>Aakash Chopra Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Aakash Chopra</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Cricket Player</strong> who was born on <strong>September 19, 1977</strong> in India, <strong>India</strong>. Right-handed batsman for India, Delhi, and the Rajasthan Royals, known for his mellow demeanor and positive approach to the game.</p><p>He wrote an article that was featured in the 2012 book <a href=#>Rahul Dravid</a>: Timeless Steel.</p><p>Chopra made his Test debut in Ahmedabad against New Zealand in late 2003 as India sought to find an opening partner for his Delhi teammate Virender Sehwag. Chopra’s international career started well, scoring two half-centuries against New Zealand during 2003/04 in the second Test in Mohali. On the 2003–04 tour to Australia, he featured in many solid partnerships with Virender Sehwag, including two century opening partnerships in Melbourne and Sydney. Chopra’s work in seeing off the new ball saw him credited with the large scores that India accumulated in that series when middle-order batsmen Rahul Dravid, V. V. S. Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly regularly compiled large centuries.</p><p>Chopra was reintroduced as Sehwag’s partner in the 2004 Border-Gavaskar Trophy after Tendulkar was injured for the First Test in Bangalore. However, a heavy loss saw Chopra axed for the following match in Chennai upon Tendulkar’s return, with Yuvraj elevated to opening the innings. Yuvraj also struggled, and Chopra was recalled for the Third Test in Nagpur. However, a double failure by Chopra, as Australia won a series in India for the first time in 35 years, saw him dropped for the last time, after his career average gradually decreased, however, from 46.25 to only 23. Chopra was replaced by Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, and was overtaken by Gambhir and Wasim Jaffer in the race to partner Sehwag in the Test side. Due to his low scoring rate, he was not considered for One Day Internationals.</p><p align=justify>He married Aakshi Mathur in December 2009.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aakash Chopra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aakash</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chopra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cricket Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1977</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>India</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>India</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Shyam Lal Chopra</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Aekta Chopra</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Aakshi Mathur</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Aakash Chopra ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
