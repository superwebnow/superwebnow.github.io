He then studied cultural psychology at the University of Chicago as a post-doctoral fellow, supervised by Jonathan Baron and Alan Fiske (at the University of Pennsylvania), and cultural anthropologist Richard Shweder (University of Chicago). At Shweder’s suggestion, he visited Orissa, India, to continue his research. In 1995, Haidt was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Virginia, where he worked until 2011, winning four awards for teaching, including a statewide award conferred by the Governor of Virginia.</p><p>Haidt’s principal line of research has been on the nature and mechanisms of moral judgment. In the 1990s, he developed the social intuitionist model, which posits that moral judgment is mostly based on automatic processes—moral intuitions—rather than on conscious reasoning. People engage in reasoning largely to find evidence to support their initial intuitions. Haidt’s main paper on the social intuitionist model, “The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail”, has been cited over 7,800 times.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jonathan Haidt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Richard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Social Psychologist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jayne Riew</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jonathan Haidt ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Jonathan Haidt's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Jonathan Haidt's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In 2004, Haidt began to extend the social intuitionist model to identify what he considered to be the most important categories of moral intuition. The resulting moral foundations theory, co-developed with Craig Joseph and Jesse Graham, and based in part on the writings of Richard Shweder, was intended to explain cross-cultural differences in morality. The theory posited that there are at least five innate moral foundations, upon which cultures develop their various moralities, just as there are five innate taste receptors on the tongue, which cultures have used to create many different cuisines. The five values are: Care/harm, Fairness/cheating, Loyalty/betrayal, Authority/subversion, and Sanctity/degradation. Haidt and his collaborators asserted that the theory also works well to explain political differences. According to Haidt, Liberals tend to endorse primarily the care and equality foundations, whereas conservatives tend to endorse all foundations more equally. Later, in The Righteous Mind, a sixth foundation, Liberty/oppression, was presented.</p><h2>Jonathan Haidt Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jonathan Haidt is one of the <strong>richest Social Psychologist</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jonathan Haidt</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Jonathan David Haidt (/h aɪ t / ; born October 19, 1963) is an American social psychologist, Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University’s Stern School of Business, and author. His main areas of study are the psychology of morality and the moral emotions.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Social Psychologist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Haidt has authored three non-academic books for general audiences, related to various subjects in psychology and politics. The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom (2006) draws on ancient philosophical ideas in light of contemporary scientific research to extract potential lessons and how they may apply to everyday life. The book poses “ten Great Ideas” on happiness espoused by philosophers and thinkers of the past – Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Jesus and others – and considers what modern scientific research has to say regarding these ideas. The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion (2012) draws on Haidt’s previous research on moral foundations theory. It argues that moral judgments arise not from logical reason, but from gut feelings, asserting that liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have different intuitions about right and wrong because they prioritize different values. The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure (2018), co-written with Greg Lukianoff, expands on an essay the authors wrote for The Atlantic in 2015. The book explores the rising political polarization and changing culture on college campuses and its effects on mental health. It also explore changes in childhood, including the rise of “fearful parenting”, the decline of unsupervised play, and the effects of social media in the last decade.</p><p>Haidt has written three books for general audiences.

This work led to the publication of an edited volume, titled Flourishing, in 2003. In 2004, Haidt began to apply moral psychology to the study of politics, doing research on the psychological foundations of ideology. This work led to the publication in 2012 of The Righteous Mind. Haidt spent the 2007–2008 academic year at Princeton University as the Visiting Professor for Distinguished Teaching.</p><p align=justify>His 2012 TED talk, “How common threats can make common [political] ground”, introduced a set of ideas on how to use moral psychology to foster collaboration among partisan opponents. In it, Haidt asserts that according to previous research in Moral Foundations Theory and how it relates to politics, that liberals generally value the first 2 categories (Care/harm and Fairness/cheating) to a high degree and are more likely to put smaller emphasis on or reject the last 3 categories (Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity) while conservatives value all 5 categories (Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity) to nearly equal degrees</p><h2>Who is Jonathan Haidt Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jonathan Haidt</strong> married to <strong>Jayne Riew</strong>.
